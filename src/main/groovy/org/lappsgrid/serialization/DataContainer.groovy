/**
 * The DataContainer class extends Data<Container> so that we can pass
 * Class instances.  For example, JSON serialization requires a class instances
 * but Java does not allow us to write Data<Container>.class, the best be can do is
 * Data.class which loses the fact that the Data object contains a Container object
 * as its payload.
 * <p>
 * Since the payload is always a Container we can reliably set the discriminator
 * to Uri.LAPPS as well.
